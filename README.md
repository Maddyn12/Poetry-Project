# Poetry-Project
This is my code for the poetry project. It takes parts of speech from "The Attraction of Levitation" by H. G. Paine and changes them.
I used Professor Whalens template where he uses "This is Just to Say" by William Carlos Williams to generate a poem.


## Idea
The idea for this code is to take the parts of speech in a poem, tag them, and then output a poem that has random parts of speech that are different from the orginial poem. I have also added some words to some of the lists to create more randomness in the poem.
